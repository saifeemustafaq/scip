Navigating the U.S. tax system as an F-1 student can be confusing, but it becomes much clearer when you understand the purpose of each form. Let's break them down into two main categories: **Forms You Receive** (information for your taxes) and **Forms You File** (your actual tax returns).

Here is an extensive but concise guide to the tax forms you should know about.

---

### **Part 1: Forms You RECEIVE (Information Reporting)**

These forms are sent to you by your employer, school, or bank. You do not send these forms to the IRS, but you use the information on them to complete your tax returns. They are typically sent in January or February for the previous calendar year.

#### **Form W-2: Wage and Tax Statement**
* **What is it?** This is the most common form for anyone with a job. It summarizes your total earnings (wages, tips) from an employer and shows how much tax (federal, state, Social Security, Medicare) was already withheld from your paychecks.
* **Who sends it?** Your employer. You will receive one from each employer you worked for during the year.
* **Why you get it:** You worked an on-campus job, or you were authorized for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT).
* **What you do with it:** Use the numbers on this form to fill out your federal (1040-NR) and state (e.g., 540NR) tax returns.

#### **Form 1042-S: Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding**
* **What is it?** This is a very important form for international students. It reports specific types of income paid to a foreign person, such as:
    * Scholarship or fellowship grants that cover living expenses (room, board, etc.).
    * Wages that are exempt from U.S. tax because of a tax treaty between your home country and the U.S.
    * Stipends or payments for services as an independent contractor (less common for F-1 students).
* **Who sends it?** Your university, or another institution that paid you.
* **Why you get it:** You received a qualifying scholarship/fellowship or you claimed a tax treaty benefit on your wages. **It's possible to receive both a W-2 and a 1042-S from the same employer** if part of your income was covered by a treaty and part was not.
* **What you do with it:** Use the information on this form to complete your Form 1040-NR.

#### **Form 1098-T: Tuition Statement**
* **What is it?** This form reports the amount of tuition you paid to your university.
* **Who sends it?** Your university.
* **Why you get it:** You paid qualified tuition and fees.
* **What you do with it:** **BE VERY CAREFUL.** This form is primarily for U.S. citizens and permanent residents to claim education tax credits (like the American Opportunity Credit). As a nonresident alien for tax purposes, you are generally **not eligible** for these credits. Most F-1 students receive this form but cannot use it. Filing for these credits incorrectly is a common mistake and can cause serious immigration and tax problems.

#### **Form 1099 Series (e.g., 1099-INT, 1099-NEC)**
* **What is it?** These forms report miscellaneous income.
    * `1099-INT`: Interest income from a bank account. For nonresident aliens, U.S. bank interest is generally not taxable and doesn't need to be reported.
    * `1099-NEC`: Income for work done as an independent contractor. F-1 students are generally **not allowed** to perform independent contractor work, so receiving this form could indicate an immigration status violation.
* **Who sends it?** A bank or a company that paid you for services.
* **What you do with it:** You likely won't need the 1099-INT for your tax return. If you receive a 1099-NEC, you should speak with your Designated School Official (DSO) and a tax professional immediately.

### **Part 2: Forms You FILL OUT & FILE**

These are the forms you (or a tax software/professional) complete and send to the government.

#### **Form W-4: Employee's Withholding Certificate**
* **What is it?** This is **not a tax return**. You fill this out when you start a new job. It tells your employer how much federal income tax to withhold from your paycheck.
* **Who do you give it to?** Your employer's HR or payroll department.
* **Special Instructions for Nonresident Aliens:** The IRS has specific instructions for you. You generally must:
    1.  Claim "Single or Married filing separately" status, regardless of your actual marital status.
    2.  Only claim one allowance (on Step 3).
    3.  Write "NRA" (Nonresident Alien) in the space on Step 4(c).
    *Following these steps ensures your withholding is calculated correctly for your status.*

#### **Form 8843: Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition**
* **What is it?** This is a crucial informational form. It is **NOT a tax return**, but it's mandatory. You use it to explain to the IRS why you should not be counted as a "resident for tax purposes" under the Substantial Presence Test.
* **Who must file it?** **EVERY F-1 student in the U.S.**, regardless of whether you earned any income or not. Your F-2 dependents must also file their own Form 8843.
* **What you do with it:** You fill it out and mail it to the IRS by the tax deadline (usually April 15). If you are also filing a 1040-NR, you attach the 8843 to it. If you have no income and don't need to file a 1040-NR, you still must send in the 8843 by itself. **Failure to file this form is a common mistake.**

#### **Form 1040-NR: U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return**
* **What is it?** This is the primary **federal income tax return** for nonresident aliens. It's the equivalent of the Form 1040 that U.S. citizens use.
* **Who must file it?** Any F-1 student who had any U.S. source income (e.g., wages from a job, a taxable scholarship). If all your income was exempt under a tax treaty, you still must file this form to report the exempt income.
* **What you do with it:** You use the information from your W-2 and/or 1042-S to complete this form, calculate your tax liability, and determine if you get a refund or owe more taxes. You then mail it to the IRS by the tax deadline.

#### **State Tax Return (e.g., California Form 540NR)**
* **What is it?** An income tax return for the specific state where you lived and worked. The "NR" in `540NR` stands for Nonresident, meaning you are a nonresident of that state for tax purposes.
* **Who must file it?** F-1 students who earned income in a state that has an income tax. Each state has its own rules and forms.
* **What you do with it:** Similar to the federal return, you use your W-2/1042-S information to complete the state form and send it to the state's tax agency.

| **1098-T** | **You Receive** | Reports tuition payments you made.                                            | Keep for your records, but **do not** use it to claim education tax credits, as you are likely ineligible.              |
| **8843** | **You File** | An informational form declaring you are an "exempt individual" from the SPT.  | **Mandatory for all F-1 students.** Mail to the IRS by the deadline, even if you had no income.                       |
| **1040-NR** | **You File** | The main U.S. federal income tax return for nonresidents.                     | File with the IRS by the deadline if you had any U.S. source income.                                                    |
| **540NR (CA)** | **You File** | A state income tax return for nonresidents of that state (example for CA).    | File with the state's tax agency if you had income in that state.                                                         |

**Key Takeaway:** Every F-1 student must file **Form 8843**. If you earned any money, you must also file a **Form 1040-NR** (federal) and likely a **state tax return**.
